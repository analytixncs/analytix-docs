On this page are a series of videos to help get you acquainted with Informer and its use with the Naviga system.

If you are using Google Chrome to view this page I would suggest that you install a video speed plugin so that you can speed up the videos as needed.  I recommend the [Video Speed Controller Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk).
