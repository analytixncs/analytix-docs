1. You can sort the shared objects by Type, Owner, or Date. Usually, you are looking for a chart from a specific Owner.
2. Once you find the owner you are looking for you can expand his node and see all the charts that he has shared.
3. When you have found the chart you are looking for, left click on the chart and drag it onto a sheet in Analytix.
4. Next, right click on the new chart and choose “Clone”. This will create a copy of the chart that is now yours.
